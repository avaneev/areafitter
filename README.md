Box Area Fitter, Fit Multiple Small Images (Box Areas) Into Several Large Images

This algorithm can optimally fit a number of small images into one or more
large output images. The algorithm works iteratively for the specified number
of iterations. The algorithm was designed in a way to provide a better fit at
the initial iterations, further iterations usually improve the result by a
small margin only.

You can specify output image width, height and area constraints.

See the example.cpp file for a basic usage example.
